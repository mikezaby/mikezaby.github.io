# About

I'm Michalis Zabaras, AKA Mike Zaby, AKA Miza Kiro, a passionate software engineer with more than a decade of experience in web development.
As a highly experienced developer, I have worked in roles such as backend, full-stack, frontend developer and tech lead.

## 🎹 All kind of keyboards
From the tactile keys of my laptop to the expressive touch of my synth and MIDI keyboards.

## 🚀 Projects
[Blibliki Engine](https://github.com/blibliki-js/engine): A data-driven audio engine for the web.

[Blibliki Grid](https://github.com/blibliki-js/grid): A visual interface for connecting modules from the Blibliki Engine.

[MyData](https://github.com/mikezaby/my_data): A Ruby client for AADE MyData.

## 💡 Collaborating
I'm always open to collaborating on audio programming projects or exploring new and interesting ideas. Feel free to reach out if you want to create something together!  

## 📚 Continuous Learning
I am always on the lookout to expand my knowledge and skills. Currently, I am trying to fine tune my WebAudio engine Blibliki, but also I want to explore new fields like re-implementing Blibliki in Rust

## ☕️ Beyond Code and music
I'm on a quest for the perfect home coffee brew. Any tips?
